# Web Template
This is a light-weight template for building packaged, tested web applications.

Support is built in for ES6 and Typescript, testing with Mocha via Karma, use of
promises, and other common necessities.

A boostrap webpage and server are built in, allowing this repository to be a fully
functional single-page app.

It is *not* opinionated on MV* frameworks, but does provide some suggestions on
template and styling languages (Handlebars and LESS, respectively).

## Build
```
npm install
gulp
```

## Run
```
npm install
gulp serve
```
